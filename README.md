# How to use it?

It will automatically be installed if you build the target in the Xcode project. 
You can download the zip file [Downloads page](https://github.com/HoZanHoi/UselessPlugin/raw/master/Plug-inTest.xcplugin.zip) which included the xcplugin file and move the product (`XcodeBracketMatcher.pbplugin`) to `~/Library/Application Support/Developer/Shared/Xcode/Plug-ins` (create the directory if necessary).
Finally, restart xcode.

# Usage

When editing an Objective-C(++) file, you can type a "`" to add "->". And it will automatically popup a completion panel after "->".

# Future

I will try my best to increase more features in the future.And you can extend if you are interested in.

# The end

Newbee in develpoing xcode plug-in. Any suggestion or mistaken ,please let me know.
